# PokeQuant (MVP)

Edge analytics & signals for premium Pok√©mon TCG cards. Cloudflare Worker + D1.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
make dev      # run worker locally
make test     # vitest
make typecheck
make lint
make smoke    # hits local endpoints
```

Deploy:
```bash
make deploy
```

Environment variables: copy `.env.example` and set via Wrangler or Cloudflare dashboard.

Rate limit overrides (optional):
- RL_SEARCH_LIMIT / RL_SEARCH_WINDOW_SEC (default 30 per 300s)
- RL_SUBSCRIBE_LIMIT / RL_SUBSCRIBE_WINDOW_SEC (default 5 per 86400s)
- RL_ALERT_CREATE_LIMIT / RL_ALERT_CREATE_WINDOW_SEC (default 10 per 86400s)

Provide as Wrangler vars to tune without code changes.

## API
See `openapi.yaml` and `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`.

## CI
GitHub Actions workflow runs:
- install deps (node cache by lock hash)
- contract check (`npm run contract`)
- version sync check (`npm run version-check`)
- lint, typecheck, tests
Fail-fast on contract or version drift to keep spec, code, and version aligned.

## Roadmap (next increments)
Refined goals:
- Historical backfill tooling for missing days
- Portfolio performance time-series endpoint
- Alert delivery integration (email/send provider)
- Enhanced signal explainability (component breakdown in API)
- Coverage threshold increases (ratchet up over time)

## License
Proprietary (set desired license).
