# Production Readiness Assessment

Last Evaluated: 2025-09-01T08:15:00Z
Overall Score: **64%** (Target for Beta: 75–80%)

## Dimension Breakdown
| Dimension | Score | Rationale | Key Gaps |
|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Functional Coverage | 80% | All MVP + analytics endpoints live; alerts/email/webhooks simulated for real delivery | Real email provider + real webhook dispatch |
| Observability & Telemetry | 70% | Latency (p50/p95), buckets, SLO breach metrics, per-error codes, retention health, signed burn alerts | External log sink, richer tracing/export, dashboard doc |
| Reliability / Resilience | 60% | Idempotent migrations, retry/backoff for webhooks, anomaly detection, retention purges | Single-region DB, no failover, limited circuit breaking |
| Delivery Integrations | 30% | Simulation + signing spec only | Real provider integration, bounce/complaint ingestion, secret rotation flow |
| Security & Guardrails | 65% | Hashed secrets, dual admin tokens, basic log redaction, rate limiting | No RBAC tiers, no secrets rotation automation, limited audit depth for auth changes |
| Test & Quality Gates | 75% | 117 tests, coverage thresholds, flake mitigated | Coverage ratchet enforcement, mutation test (optional) |
| Frontend UX | 40% | Static pages only | SPA scaffold + accessibility & performance budgets |

## Immediate Priority Actions (Raise Score Fast)
1. Integrate real email provider (send + bounce/complaint ingest) behind feature flag.
2. Enable real webhook dispatch with secret rotation endpoint & metrics namespace split.
3. Enforce coverage ratchet in CI (fail on regression; optional auto-update path).
4. Scaffold SvelteKit frontend (cards + movers + card detail + portfolio lots).

## Secondary Actions
- External logs shipping (R2 or third-party) + expanded redaction test.
- Automated backup verification & restore drill doc.
- Add `/admin/slo/recommend` endpoint for adaptive threshold suggestions.

## Risk Register (Top 5)
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Single-region D1 outage | Full API downtime | Medium | Document RTO, plan read-replica strategy post-Beta |
| Email/webhook integration delay | Delays Beta readiness | Medium | Start provider DNS immediately, keep simulation fallback |
| Coverage regression unnoticed | Hidden reliability drift | Low | Add ratchet gate + daily coverage trend badge |
| Log noise / sensitive field leakage when shipping externally | Compliance / data exposure | Low | Strengthen redaction patterns + add test harness |
| Residual test flake resurfacing | CI noise, slower iteration | Low | Shared retry helper & readiness probe escalation |

## Monitoring & Alerting Baselines
- Core API SLO breach ratio (<5% primary routes).
- Webhook/email delivery success ratio (>95% once real).
- Daily pipeline success (target 30/30 pre-GA).

## Decision Follow-Ups
- Email provider decision record pending (Resend vs Postmark) — deadline: 2025-09-03.
- Coverage ratchet strategy (auto-commit vs fail-only) — decide before enabling gate.

## Exit Criteria Toward Beta (Delta)
- [+] Real delivery integrations active.
- [+] Coverage ratchet enforced.
- [+] SPA skeleton merged.
- [+] Runbook updated with provider + webhook operational steps.
